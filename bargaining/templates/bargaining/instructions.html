            You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
            There is {{ amount_shared }} for you to divide.
            Both of you have to simultaneously and independently demand a portion
            of the {{ amount_shared }} for yourselves. If the sum of your
            demands is smaller or equal to {{ amount_shared }}, both of
            you get what you demanded. If the sum of your demands is larger
            than {{ amount_shared }},
            both of you get nothing.
