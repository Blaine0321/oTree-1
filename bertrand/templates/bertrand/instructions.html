        Each of you privately sets your price, anything from 0 to {{ maximum_price }}.
        The buyer in the market will always buy one unit of the product at the
        lower price. In case of a tie, the buyer will buy from one of you at
        random. Your profit is your price if your product is sold and zero
        otherwise.{% endblocktrans %}
